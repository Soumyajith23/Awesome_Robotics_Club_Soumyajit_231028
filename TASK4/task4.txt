From my school days, I have had a lot of interest in robotics. I love playing with microcontrollers like Arduino and sensors. I have also made a rover model with robotic arms for my school project. However, as I was a kid and the equipment was not provided by the school, the output was not so good(We made the arm with servos and the structure with ice cream sticks). So, I want to seize this opportunity to work on this project, utilize advanced equipment, and achieve a great outcome while learning something new.
